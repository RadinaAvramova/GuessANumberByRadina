Guess A Number is a simple guessing game where a user is supposed to guess the number that your opponent (the computer) has come up with. The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100. It will then ask the player to enter their guess. Each time you enter a number, the computer will tell you whether it is lower or higher than the expected number.

You win the game when your number matches your computer number.

# Input and Output

Choose a number between 1 and 100, then press Enter.

The computer selects a random number, then returns information whether the number is less than, greater than, or equal to the selected number.
